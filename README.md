# MathApi

It's a simple math
 package,providing some math classes (such as Matrix and Vector class) to make calculations easier and help you with some useful functions, such as Vector multiply or Matrix determinant finding (will be added soon)
The package firstly created for a calculations, related to the 3d graphics projection on a 2d screen, so now it has a following list of classes

### Classes
- Vector (4-dimensional)
- Matrix (4-dimensional)
  
  and it provides a following functionality
### Functionality
  - vector and scalar multiplying (`vector*a`), 
  - vector cross product (`vector*vector = vector`)
  - vector's dot product (`vector*vector = number`)
  - matrix multiplying (`matrix*marix = matrix`)
  
**the list will be upgraded and more functionality added with a time flows**

Thank's for using
